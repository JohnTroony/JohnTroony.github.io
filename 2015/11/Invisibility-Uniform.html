      <p>Taking down terrorists, securing the borders of a country, being proactive and neutralizing potential threats before they spawn as attacks.... That is the line of thinking when we talk about DoD and any Army... Being one step ahead of the enemy has always been the rule of thumb. </p>
<p>When the president of U.S.A., Obama, visited Kenya on July 2015; there was different kind of reactions all over the world without forgetting CNN claiming Kenya to be a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/14/cnn-kenya-apologise-obama">"Hot bed of terror"</a>. Kenya has been attacked by Al-Shabab militia group without clear ways of curbing such attacks and it was a surprise to some on how Obama would survive such threats while in Kenya.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the guys who work with the secret service were well prepared to have Obama hosted in Kenya. As soon as He was received and welcomed here in Nairobi, there was a human-like moving object captured by one of the local TV station and while many people claimed it was a demon or a ghost (I dunno the difference), my <a href="https://twitter.com/harryness1o1">buddy</a> and I laughed off as we had seen another "similar" video and we knew probably what the secret service might have as part of preparations.... :D</p>
<p>All sorts of conspiracy theories spewed on the Internet and social media, many claiming Obama has demons and other funny or rather crazy imaginations of Illuminati-ish stories. Below is a clip from a local popular (people's choice) TV show in Kenya #TheTrend discrediting the theories around the "demon caught on tape"...</p>

<p>What people failed to talk about was who/why whatever was caught on tape, was there... Why only Citizen TV caught that exact moving object and not any other camera present on the airport. </p>
<p>There can only be one reason, a reason that can qualify as a sound theory. The guy caught on camera is a solider/secret service wearing an invisible suit, now before you close this blog page and call me all manner of names.... Watch the video below.</p>
<p><strong>P.S. You can Skip all the mambo jambo and jump to the interesting part.. <a href="https://youtu.be/l7J3kJ5Ae3A?t=258">by clicking HERE!</a></strong></p>

<p>The above video was published on Feb 15, 2013. The only reason why the guy seen on the video was recored by the camera is due to the position of the camera and the angle at which the light is beaming from, the same thing that happened with "demon caught on tape", Citizen TV camera was positioned in a way they could get a glimpse of a moving object recorded... </p>
<p>Now just to sink in the point and bring you closer to this awesome theory of "Invisible Cloak", below are some links to similar project and news from credible sources on possibility of having such suits developed by the military... It's no longer a secret!</p>
